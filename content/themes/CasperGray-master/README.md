# CasperGray


## Description
Based on [Casper](https://github.com/TryGhost/Casper), the default theme for [Ghost](https://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).<br>
I've just made some small CSS changes, all to grayscale colors. Images automatically converted to grayscale, but you can see in colors if you put your mouse cursor over them.


##Installation

Copy it to your themes folder:

    cd /path/to/ghost/content/themes
    sudo git clone https://github.com/semeano/CasperGray.git

Restart Ghost and you should be able to see the theme option on general settings.
